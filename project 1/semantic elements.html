                    <p>
                        Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.
                        In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions.
                         Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.
                          The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe.
                           However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.

                    In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. 
                    According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.
                     Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space
